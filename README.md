# projects
These are projects that resulted from some caffeine-fueled, sleep-deprived problem-solving, built entirely in my free time between Netflix episodes. It’s simple and mini where I wrote some codes to make something work. It’s probably more of an amateur attempt than anything else, but it gets the job done. Hope it’s useful to someone!

## Details

<p><b>- #1: Rainfall Data from Data.gov API</b></p>
<p>Extracting and transforming from Data.gov API: Rainfall across Singapore.</p>
<p>https://data.gov.sg/datasets?formats=API&sort=relevancy&page=1&resultId=d_6580738cdd7db79374ed3152159fbd69#tag/default/GET/rainfall</p>
<p>This project pulls and processes rainfall data from Singapore's Data.gov API. It all started from a task I didn’t quite nail, which led me to figure things out on my own.
In this mini project, I focused on extracting, transforming, and working with the data in a way that made sense.
A small win for me, and hopefully useful to anyone else working with similar datasets.</p>
<p>Requirements: List of packages or libraries (e.g., `requests`, `json`, `duckdb`)</p>
