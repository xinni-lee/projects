# projects
These are projects that resulted from some caffeine-fueled, sleep-deprived problem-solving, built entirely in my free time between Netflix episodes. It’s simple and mini where I wrote some code to make something work. It’s probably more of an amateur attempt than anything else, but it gets the job done. Hope it’s useful to someone!
